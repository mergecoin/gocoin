## Generating a Personal Access Token
For local development, a Personal Access Token from Github is required. If you need a new one go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens]() and generate a new one. Required scopes are `admin:repo_hook, repo, user`.

If you commit code with your personal access code in it, Github will automatically revoke the token.

## Creating a release
TODO

## Testing the code
run `go run main.go` on the terminal.
